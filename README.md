# Erosion_Inari_Finland
Here we provide fire and soil erosion data generated for our paper entitled “Wildfire-induced soil erosion in northern Finland watersheds”. This study was conducted at two lakes (Muotka and Inka) in northern Finland (around 69°N and 26°E). We investigated the correspondence between fire events and soil erosion within the lakes’ watersheds during the Holocene (last 11,000 years). Soil erosion was assessed using magnetic susceptibility and geochemistry (X-ray fluorescence) measurements. Peaks in the charcoal, magnetic susceptibility and geochemistry series were identified with the CharAnalysis software (https://github.com/phiguera/CharAnalysis).

For each lake, Muotka and Inka, dates of the detected fire and erosion events are provided in separated tables, each with 5 columns:
(1)	CharAnalysis fire events (cal yr BP): Dates of fire events detected with the CharAnalysis software, including both regional fires and fires having occurred within the watershed.
(2)	CSD fire events (cal yr BP): Dates of fire events having occurred within the watershed as identified with the charcoal size distribution (CSD) method.
(3)	MS events (cal yr BP): Dates of soil erosion events detected in the magnetic susceptibility (MS) series. 
(4)	Ca/Fe events (cal yr BP): Dates of soil erosion events detected in the Ca/Fe ratio series analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF).
(5)	High severity fire events (cal yr BP): Dates of fire events (column 2) coinciding with erosion events (column 3) within the watershed.
